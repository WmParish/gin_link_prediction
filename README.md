# GNN for Link Prediction in Historical Data

This repository contains code developed for a National Science Foundation-funded project exploring digital methods to investigate the historical imbrication of time and space during the Holocaust. As part of the project, I implemented a Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN) adapted from the seminal paper, ["How Powerful are Graph Neural Networks"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.00826) by Xu et al. The model was used for link prediction tasks.

The data consisted of Holocaust survivor testimonies to which we were granted access through the project. Due to the sensitive nature of the data, the code in this repository has been generalized for use with historical or textual data more broadly. For more information about the project, visit the NSF award page [here](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2225179&HistoricalAwards=false).

All files in this repository were created by me as part of this research, but they represent only a portion of the broader digital methods used in the project. At the conclusion of the project, we will release a separate, comprehensive repository that includes these files along with others developed by the team to showcase the full range of digital humanistic methods applied. This description will be updated once that repository is made public.

**Additional information on dependencies, batching, etc. will be made available shortly.**
